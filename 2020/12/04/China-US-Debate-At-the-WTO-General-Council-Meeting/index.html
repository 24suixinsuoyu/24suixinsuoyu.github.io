<h4 id="Ambassador-Shea"><a href="#Ambassador-Shea" class="headerlink" title="Ambassador Shea"></a>Ambassador Shea</h4><p>Thank you, Mr.Chairman. Before delivering my prepared remarks, let me offer an introductory observation. Some have asked why we have placed this item on today’s agenda, tha answer is simple. This discussion is long overdue. Few issues are as critical to the future viability of this institution as the unique economic system raised by China. I know my colleague, Ambassador Zhang, will have something to say in response to my remarks. He may have a lot to say, but I welcome his comments. We are sure that our goal is not to upset or provoke, but to shed light or perhaps even educate. We are confident that through constructive dialogue and analysis the truth will eventually reveal itself.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, one of the most critical issues facing the WTO membership is China’s failure to fully embrace the open, market-oriented policies on which this institution is founded.</p>
<p>Despite China’s repeated portrayal of itself as a staunch defender of free trade and the global trading system, China is in fact the most protectionist, mercantilist economy in the world. Contrary to Member’s expectations, China has not been moving toward a fuller embrace of market-based policies and practices since it joined the WTO in 2001. In fact, the opposite is true. The state’s role in China’s economy has been increasing.</p>
<p>If China’s economy were small, the problems posed by China’s state-led, mercantilist approach to trade and investment would not have as serious repercusstions for China’s trading partners and the WTO itself. But China’s economy is not small. Over the past 17 years, China’s economy, and  China’s role in the global trading system, have grown dramatically. China is now one of the WTO’s largest traders.</p>
<p>China’s size magnifies the harm caused by its state-led, mercantilist approach to trade and investment, and this harm is growing every day and can no longer be tolerated.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, in the paper that we submittd for today’s meeting, we focus on China’s econnomic model which has proven to be particularly trade-disruptive.</p>
<p>The Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party have a constitutional mandate, echoed in China’s broader legal framework, to develop a “socialist market economy”. To this end, the government and the Communist Party continue to exercise control directly and indirectly over the allocation of resources through instruents such as governmnet ownership and control of key economic actors and government directives. As a result, the means of production are not sufficiently allocated or priced according to market principles. Instead, the government and the Communist Party continue to control or otherwise influence the price of key factors of production, including land, labor, energy and capital.</p>
<p>Just as when China acceded to the WTO in 2001, state-owned enterprises continue to play an outsized role in  China’s economy. Moreover, the government and the Communist Party have for decades exercised control over these enterprises through the appointment of key executives and the provision of preferential access to land, energy and capital and other important inputs, among other means.</p>
<p>Recently, the Communist Party also has taken steps to increase the strength and presence of the Communist Party within all business organizations in China. These efforts are so pervasive that the Delegations of Germany Industry and Commerce released a public statement in Noverber 2017 pushing back against attempts by the Communist Party “to strengthen their influence in wholly foreign-owned German companies in China.”</p>
<p>China’s system also treats law as an instrument of the state, in the sense that it is used to facilitate the government’s industrial policy goals and to secure discrete economic outcomes. In addition, key legal institutions, such as the courts, are structured to respond to the Communist Party’s direction. This type of system makes it very difficult for enterprises to act independently of approved industrial policies on a systemic or consistent basis.</p>
<p>China’s leading companies attest to the fundamental non-market nature of China’s economy today. For example, the technology firm Alibaba has stated that “a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government,” “the PRC government continue to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies” and “the PRC government also exercises significant control over China’s economic growth by allocating resources.”</p>
<p>China is currently in its 13th five-year planning cycle, a hallmark of a planned economy that has become more, not less, salient since China joined the WTO. Various institutions participate in formulation and execution of industrial policy plans, including central government agencies with legislative and regulatory authority, thousands of local government authorities, various organs of the Communist Party and Chinese enterprises.</p>
<p>A key focus of China’s industrial policies is technology development, which China views as integral to its economic development. Currently, China is seeking to attain domestic market dominance and global leadership in a wide range of advanced technologies. In pursuit of this overarching objective, China has issued a large number of industrial policies, including, for example, the “Made in China 2025” industrial plan.</p>
<p>Among other things, China’s industrial policies deploy massive market-distorting subsidies and provide other forms of financial support for targeted domestic industries. All too ofter, severe and persistent excess capacity results. Excess capacity hurts the global economy not only through direct exports from China, but also because lower global prices and a glut of supply make it difficult for even the most competitive producers to remain viable, as we have seen in the steel, aluminum and solar sectors.</p>
<p>Of course, subsidization is by no means the only tool that China uses to support its domestic industries. As an example, as Members likely are aware, the United States issued a detailed factual report in March of this year that illustrates how China has pursued a variety of unreasonable policies and practices that harm U.S. intellectual property rights, innovation and technology development. These types of policies and practices injure not only the United States, of course, but also other WTO Members.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China continues to benefit tremendously from its WTO membership. China now is the world’s largest automotive market, the world’s largest oil importer, the world’s largest steel manufacturer and the world’s largest meat consumer, and it has six megacities with over 10 million residents. China also hosts the largest number of super-computers in the world. While China undoubtedly struggles with poverty-realted challenges in some areas of its economy, the claim that it is a developing country on par with many others, and therefore should be exempt from contributing to progressive liberalization of global trade rules, is simply not sustainable when measured against numerous indicators of China’s rapid development and accumulation of wealth.</p>
<p>Since joining the WTO, China has repeatedly signaled that it is pursuing economic reform. Unfortunately, China’s use of the term “reform” differs from the type of reform that a country would be pursuing if it were embracing market-oriented principles. For China, economic reform means perfecting the government’s and the Communist Party’s management of the economy and strengthening the state sector, particularly state-owned enterprises. As long as China remains on this path, the implications for this organization are decidedly negative.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, China’s basic response to criticisms about its trade-disruptive economic model is to assert that China strictly adheres to its WTO obligations. That’s the thrust of its recent white paper, “China and the World Trade Organization”, which China has handed out for today’s meeting. China holds itself out as a “model” for other WTO Members to emulate and asserts that it “firmly observes and upholds the WTO rules, and supports the multilateral trading system that is open, transparent, inclusive and non-discriminatory.”</p>
<p>China’s portrayal of itself is not accurate, of course, as many of us know.</p>
<p>China’s while paper, which is 22 pages long, provides few details about the actual policies and practices that China pursues and does not discuss the many problems that other Members have identified.</p>
<p>The United States, for example, has produced a 148-page report that catalogues in great detail the numerous problematic trade and investment policies and practices that China pursues. The United States submitted this report, the “2017 USTR Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance”, in connection with today’s meeting. If Members want to truly understand the unique problem that China poses for this institution, I would recommend reading that report, along with our paper on China’s economic model.</p>
<p>What will become obvious is the unusually large number of serious concerns about China’s trade and investment regime. In so many cases, these serious concerns arise because the Chinese government, or a Chinese government official, has intervened in the market. Unfortunately, that’s what can be expected when a WTO Member pursus a state-led, mercantilist approach to trade and investment.</p>
<p>China ofter describe its approach as “win-win”. In face, it uses the term “win-win” eight time in its 22-page white paper. But that’s not accurate. China pursues industrial policies that typically go well beyond traditional approaches to guiding and supporting demestic industries. As is catalogued in the USTR report, China seeks to support its domestic industries too often by enacting measures and taking actions that impede, disadvantage and harm the foreign eompetition. In other words, China’s approach seems to be based more on the view that trade is a “zero-sum game” rather than the view that free, fair and reciprocal trade is mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, our purpose in bringing this situation to the attention of the General Council is two-fold.</p>
<p>First, we want to ensure that Members truly understand that change si necessary if the WTO is to remain relevant to the international trading system.</p>
<p>Second, we want to make clear that the best solution from a WTO perspective is for China finally to take the initiative to fully and effectively embrace open, market-oriented policies like other WTO Members. As we explained during China’s recent trade policy review, the WTO itself does not currently provide the tools needed to bring about that change. Rather, if the necessary change is to take place, it’s up to China.</p>
<h4 id="Ambassador-Zhang-Xiangchen"><a href="#Ambassador-Zhang-Xiangchen" class="headerlink" title="Ambassador Zhang Xiangchen"></a>Ambassador Zhang Xiangchen</h4><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>
<p>The remarks by the US Ambassador Shea moment ago have made the air smell like gunpower in this Council room.</p>
<p>We should thank Ambassador Shea, as he reminded us that we are now in an unprecedented crisis of the multilateral trading system, and we can no longer sit leisurely by the lakeside, enjoying the sunshine and summer breeze. I would like to thank Ambassador Shea in particular for sending me a copy of the US submission on China’s Trade-Disruptive Economic Model on 13 July, so that I can digest this heavy cake before I come to this meeting. But much to my disappiontment, that to me, it tastes more like a half-cooked dough than a cake.</p>
<p>Then, how should I respond? As a matter of fact, the Trade Policy Review is a collective appreciation and evaluation of Members’ trade policy and practices. Two weeks ago, we have just finished the 7th Trade Policy Review of China, during which my colleague, Vice-Minister Wang Shouwen has answered quite many questions including those showed up in the US paper. Should any Members wish to criticize other Members’ trade policy under other mechanism, I have no objection. If you feel like having more to say, I am then all ears. Although I do not believe the WTO is the appropriate place to discuss the economic models of Members, I chose not to block the adoption of this agenda item at today’s meeting of the General Council. Because blocking the normal proceedings and forcing a WTO body out of operation is definitely not our way of doing things.</p>
<p>In response to those charges raised by the US in its paper, I can reiterate what China has stated in our trade policy review, that is, the state-owned enterprises in China are market entities, carrying out autonomous operation and assuming sole responsibility for profits or loses; the root cause for overcapacity is contraction of global demand following the financial crisis; China has no legal provisions that impose compulsory requirements on technology transfer; the industrial policies in China are guidance in nature; China has strictly abided by its WTO accession commitments and implemented all dispute settlement rulings; China’s development has benefited the whole world; as a developing country, China still has a long way to go in terms of achieving comprehensive and balanced development and etc. I can go on elaborating all these facts and we can call it a day at the meeting. But for me, this might seem a bit unfair to our US colleagues who have spent many hours in drafting this paper. As we say, it is impolite not to reciprocate. The US submission has a dozen pages, to respond to it might take around 30 minutes. I never liked to make long interventions, but I’ll have to ask for your indulgence today.</p>
<p>I believe there are some basic rules to follow both in terms of giving and receiving criticism. For those who receive criticism, they should have an open mind for any criticism and embrace those criticisms that are fair and just. This should be the case no matter how harsh the criticism is or how much factual it is. We should treat the criticism in the spirity of correcting mistakes if you have made any and guarding against them if you have not. Actually in my Mission we are often having criticism and self-criticism among our colleagues. So please rest assured that we do have enough courage and broad mind to receive criticisms.</p>
<p>To be fair, for those who give criticism, they should also abided by some basic principles. For example, criticism should be based on facts, should refrain from putting labels on others, should use correct facts and correctly use facts, there should be clear logic in reaching conclusions through analyzing evidence. Only in this way, can criticism be convincing and produce good results.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the US paper seem to fall short of these principles. Let me just give you a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>First, regard one’s own views as other’s positions or even the multilateral rules.</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1992, when China announced that it would build a socialist market economy, right in the Room W, a question was posed to a Chinese delegate, that is, what is a socialist market economy? I clearly remember this delegate replying that the socialist market economy was the economy under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. 26 years passed since then, we have never changed our position. As for those who speculated that China would change and move onto a different path upon its WTO accession, but that was just their wishful thinking. There are more than one model of market economy in this world. China has been vigorously exploring a road of market economy which suits China’s own national situation and circumstances, and we have made remarkable progress in this endeavor. Whatever others may say, we will march along this road unswervingly.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Dennis mentioned the term “non-market nature of China’s economy”. However, we can’t find the definition of “market economy” throughout the WTO rule book. There is no one-size-fits-all “market economy” standard in the world. The WTO rules never authorize any Member to use its own economic model as the template of “market economy”, and to access any other Member who would not copy it as a “non-market economy”.</p>
<p>If there is any relevance in the topic of “non-market economy”, it reminds us once again that there are certain Mebmber, including US, who, disregarding the WTO rules and their own commitments, are still using the notorious “surrogate country” methodology in anti-dumping investigations according to the “market economy” standards of their domestic laws. I would like to take this opportunity to urge these Members once again, “pacta sunt servanda”. Please honor your commitments 17 years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman,</p>
<p>Paragraph 1.5 of the US paper partially quoted an expression from the Communique of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee, that is, “the government plays its role better”. The US paper omitted the rest part of sentence, which says “the market should play a decisive role in allocating resources”. In this regard, it is critically important to recognize the decisive role that market plays in allocating resources, as this is precisely the economic and institutional basis upon which China promotes its economic and trade relations with the WTO Members.</p>
<p>Please allow me to give you a full quote of the entire paragraph in the Communique. “Economic structural reform is the focus of deepening the reform comprehensively. The underlying issue is how to strike a balance between the role of the government and that of the market, and let the market play the decisive role in allocating resources and let the government play its functions better. It is a general rule of the market economy that the market decides the allocation of resources. We have to follow this rule when we improve the socialist market economy. We should work hard to address the problems of imperfections in the market system, too much government interference and poor oversight.”</p>
<p>Similarly, preamble of the US paper partially quoted the Marrakech Declaration of 1994, that the multilateral trading system should be “based upon open, market-oriented policies”. However, the paper intentionally omitted the rest part of sentence, which says “(based upon…) and the commitments set out in the Uruguay Round Agreements and Decisions”. This second half sentence is extremely important, as each Member has its own domestic policy objectives, and that the results of multilateral megotiations are a balance between Member’s domestic policies and the process of global trade liberalization.</p>
<p>Such balance is reflected in the rules, the tariff schedules and services of Members, which contain descriptions of Members’ legitimate regulatory policies and measures. To put it simple, the WTO Agreement is a set of contracts achieved through negotiations. Within the scope of those contracts, Members abide by the conditions set forth in the contracts. Beyond the scope of those contracts, Members have their own policy space.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman,</p>
<p>The Article 16 of China’s Constitution clearly states that state-owned enterprises have decision-making power over their operation and management. The US paper spends many paragraphs trying to argue that the Chinese government “controls” enterprises. But the paper failed to provide evidence to prove that the government intervenes in the normal operation of the enterprises.</p>
<p>I once had a debate with a US senior official over this point. He later conceded that he was unable to provide evidence. At the end of the debate, he said that control was not science, it was an art. With his such words, the debate was adjourned. But for me, I would not agree with the notion that thousands of enterprises in China are controlled by a group of artists.</p>
<p>It is known to many colleagues present today that the real purpose of the US is not only trying to prove that Chinese enterprises are controlled by the government, but also trying to establish kind of logic. That is, so long as enterprises are controlled by the government, they therefore assume and perform part of government functions and therefore should be deemed as “public bodies” in the context of WTO and should undertake obligations under the WTO agreements such as Subsidies and Countervailing Agreement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such logic was overturned by the Appellate Body. In the US-China Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties case, the Appellate Body stated that “the mere ownership or control over an entity by a government, without more, is not sufficient to establish that the entity is a public body”. I was told that our Amerian colleagues have been quite unhappy with losing this case, but the ruling of the Appellate Body cannot be challenged.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman,</p>
<p>Let me give you another example. In paragraph 1.14 of the paper, the US questioned China for using “Social Credit System” as “new tool to monitor, rate and condition the conducts of all enterprises in China”. But the fact is that such a system is meant to create a fair and credible business environment and prevent fraud and misbehavior. And China’s “Social Credit System” is based on the experiences of over 60 countries that have established a similar public credit system, including in France and Germany. Is it simply because of its differences from that of the US that such system becomes a tool to monitor and control enterprises?</p>
<p><strong>Second, there lacks consistency in the standards used in assessing Members’ policies.</strong></p>
